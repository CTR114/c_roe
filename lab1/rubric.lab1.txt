Lab 1 Rubric
Student Name: Chris Roe

Lab 1 Part 1:
4 points max for style and documentation:  __3__
   documentation (name and date comment)
     -FYI: no date given on hello.cpp

   user interface
     -Need to be more careful on formatting when prompting for user input
      (and giving output in general).  For example, here are your prompts for
      calculator.app:

         Enter first argument/number:10
         Enter second argument.number10

      The format of the two prompts are different (argument/number,
      argument.number), and there is no separate between the prompt
      and value entered by the user for the second argument.

      (Think of these kinds of formatting error for a lab as being similar
       to a paper with typos and mispellings.)

   source code
      -Be sure to always use consistent indentation to help visually 
       indicate blocks of code. Mostly, your programs are doing this, 
       but not calculator.cpp.

      instructions).

NOTE:  Deductions for program errors
   -1 for each program that compiles and runs but with some important defects
   -2 for each program that compiles and runs but is basically incorrect
   -3 for each program that does not compile / was not created
   (up to a maximum deduction of 18)

You need to take more care with spacing ("called3times", "us :7") and 
making sure the prompt is returned to the user on the next line.

[-0.5] source code

   -In calc2.cpp, instead of declaring separate ints j, k, r, and h
    in each conditional code block, declare one int variable at the
    top of main and reuse the variable.

   -Also, you need to be using more meaningful variable names than
    single character-names (a, j, k, etc.)

   -Blank lines to separate function definitions and major blocks of
    code, but be careful not to get carried away (e.g., password3.cpp).
