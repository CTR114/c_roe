Lab 4 Part 3 - ImageStacker
Student: Chris Roe

   Style / UI / Program documentation: _4_ pts out of 10
      - only wrote 1 helper; I expected 4 or 5.
      - main function is 38 lines of code; I expected less than 20.
      - You need to practice breaking down the problem into a set of helper functions
         to be documented and implemented.  Then, if you implement and test each function,
         the whole working program comes together much more smoothly.

      Diagnosis:
         You're reading from the `files` stringstream using getline, but the filenames are
         space-separated.  So, the entire stringstream is being funneled into file[0] and
         the rest of the filenames are blank...
               for (int i= 0; i<Num_Files;i++)
               {
                   getline(files, file[i]);  // PROBLEM #1
               }
