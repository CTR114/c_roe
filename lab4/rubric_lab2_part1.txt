   Always put a space on both sides of every binary operator symbol.
      Not like this: for (int j = 0; j<cols; j++)
                     {
                        cout<< " Enter the number you want to use for,"<< " " << i << ", "<< j << "\n";
                        cin>> p_p_tictactoe[i][j];
                        cout<<"\n";
                     }
      But like this: for (int j = 0; j < cols; j++)
                     {
                        cout << " Enter the number you want to use for,"<< " " << i << ", "<< j << "\n";
                        cin >> p_p_tictactoe[i][j];
                        cout <<"\n";
                     }

   UI Errors:
      In Step 5, don't ask for a "number", ask for a "character."
      In Step 6, print a space after each character.


Correctness of Implementation:  _12_ of 18

   Crucial error in step 4:  For loop needs to end when i == rows - 1, not when i == cols - 1

   Memory leak when #cols > #rows:

      Enter how many rows you would like:
      3
      Enter the number of columns you would like
      2
       Enter the number you want to use for, 0, 0
      q

       Enter the number you want to use for, 0, 1
      w

       Enter the number you want to use for, 1, 0
      e

       Enter the number you want to use for, 1, 1
      r

       Enter the number you want to use for, 2, 0
      t
      Segmentation fault

   TIP:  You should have tested #rows < #cols, and #rows > #cols.  Your program only works
   when #rows == #cols.

Total for tictactoe.cpp:   _16_ pts out of 25

Program should:
   -ask for number of rows then number of columns
   -create 2-D array of chars in dynamic memory of size rows x cols
   -ask for chars one position at a time and populate 2-D array
   -print out 2-D array in a grid
   -free allocated memory using delete
