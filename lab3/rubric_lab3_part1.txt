Grading for Lab 3, Part 1

Lab 3 Part 1 - The Throttle Class:

**Style / Program documentation:     __1.5__ pts out of 2
    [-0.5 pts] Looks mostly okay, but here are a couple things to work on style-wise:
      -Clean up unnecessary comments (e.g., leftover from debugging or incorrect 
       implementations) and excessive blank lines, like toward the top of throttle.cpp.
      -Write functions that return booleans more succinctly.  For example, is_on can be simplified from this:

     if (position > 0)
     {
         return true;
     }
     else
     {
         return false;
     }

        to this:

     return (position > 0);


**Implementation (throttle.cpp):     __30__ pts out of 40

COMPILER ERROR! [-10]:
throttle.cpp: In member function ‘bool main_savitch_2A::throttle::is_on() const’:
throttle.cpp:108:10: error: ‘else’ without a previous ‘if’
          else
          ^

    bool throttle::is_on() const
    {
         if ((flow() > 0));  <----- this semicolon is the problem
         {
            return true;
         }
         else
         {
            return false;
         }

    }

    Once compiler error is fixed, all tests pass:
      TESTING THROTTLE CLASS
      Testing default constructor . . . PASSED!
      Testing 1-parameter constructor . . . PASSED!
      Testing shift() to maximum  . . . PASSED!
      Testing shut_off() when throttle is on . . . PASSED!
      Testing shut_off() when throttle is off . . . PASSED!
      Test shifting up incrementally . . . PASSED!
      Test shifting down incrementally . . . PASSED!
      Testing large shift values . . . PASSED!
      DONE



**Testing (throttle_test.cpp):       __2__ pts out of 5
     -Total asserts: 10 (4 given)

   Comments:
     -Many more tests needed, including a test for the non-default constructor.

PART 1 TOTAL:   33.5 pts out of 47

========================================================

GRADING GUIDELINES (for professors' use -- don't send to students)

   Implementation - 40 points max (Throttle Class or Person Class)
      40: student code runs perfectly on professor's testing code
      35: student code fails a few of the professors' tests, but is mostly correct
      30: student code fails a lot of the professor's tests, but still passes a majority
      0-29: student code fails a majority of the professor's tests

   Testing for Throttle Class - 5 points max
   NOTE: grade is related to student's grade for Throttle class implementation
      0-5: student code runs perfectly on professor's testing code
      0-3: student code fails a few of the professor's tests, but is mostly correct
      0-2: student code fails many or a majority of the professor's tests

Final Note:
-----------
  If they submit implementation code which fails professor's tests, then either
     a) they are not writing good testing code, or
     b) they are not making effective use of their good testing code.
  Either way, we penalize their testing grade for failures in their implementation
  code.
