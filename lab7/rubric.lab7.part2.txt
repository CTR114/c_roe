Lab 7 Part 2: Linked-list Stack Template
Due Monday 3-20-17
Student: Chris Roe

TESTING (stack_test.cpp): 20 pts out of 30

   - Good job testing the stack using different types of data,
     but you're missing a lot of important tests, e.g., when the stack is
     empty or only contains one thing, testing self-assignment, etc.
   - Tests for exception handling not implemented.


IMPLEMENTATION (stack.template): 17 pts out of 20

  pop
    Does not check for an empty stack before popping.

  equiv/inequiv
    It looks like you are trying to advance a cursor-type pointer to a node
    when you loop through equivalent-sized stacks to compare individual items.
    Except, you never create a cursor node pointer, and so it never gets
    advanced inside the loop.

  Mastertest Report:
    Number of segmentation faults encountered during testing = 1
    Number of tests passed = 33 out of 35
    Number of tests failed = 2 out of 35
    Percent of tests passed = 94.2857%

    Testing equivalence, inequivalence . . .
      equneq.test.5: ### TEST FAILED ###: same size, diff first value

    Testing that exceptions are thrown when necessary . . .
      ### TEST FAILED ###: pop and empty stack; segmentation fault

  Valgrind Report (avoid memory leaks!):
    All heap blocks were freed -- no leaks are possible


Part 2 TOTAL: 37 out of 50
