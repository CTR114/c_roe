Lab 7 Part 1: Circular-array Queue
Due Thursday 3-16-17
Student: Chris Roe

Testing (queue_test.cpp): 14 pts out of 25

  Fomatting and documentation:
     - Testing was decomposed into individual functions, but otherwise
       no in-program comments or descriptive output was used to document
       the individual tests. [-4 pts]

  Missing Tests:
   test_equiv_inequiv
     - queues are same size, same values except for last item in each queues; returns false
     - queues are equivalent, but with different values for front index; returns true
     - queues are equivalent, but at least one queue wraps around from back to front
          (tests circular-nature of array)

   test_reverse: 
     - empty queue
     - works when front of queue is not at index 0
     - works when queue wraps around from back to front (tests circular-nature)

   test_automatic_assignment_operator (tests default implementation given by compiler):
     - assign an empty queue
     - assign shorter queue to longer queue
     - works for self-assignment
     - object independence after assignment

  Additional Feedback:
    - Just checking the front of the queue is not sufficient to test that
      reverse worked without error.

Implementation (queue.cpp): 21 pts out of 25

  reverse
    -Right idea for reversing the queue in-place, but remember the items
     in the queue could start at any index, and perhaps wrap arouond from
     the end of the array to the beginning.  This makes getting the indexes
     correct for the in-pace swap a bit trickier.

  equivalence/inequivalence:
    -Incorrectly returns false when comparing two queues with the same items but
     different values for instance variables first & last

  Mastertest Report:
    Number of tests passed = 48 out of 54
    Number of tests failed = 6 out of 54
    Percent of tests passed = 88.8889%

    Testing equivalence, inequivalence . . .
      equneq.test.3: ### TEST FAILED ###: same size, same values, same order

    Testing reverse . . .
      reverse.test.3: ### TEST FAILED ###: queue of size 2
      reverse.test.4: ### TEST FAILED ###: queue of size 3
      reverse.test.5: ### TEST FAILED ###: full queue
      reverse.test.6: ### TEST FAILED ###: with first=28 and last=5
      reverse.test.7: ### TEST FAILED ###: with first=25 and last=2
